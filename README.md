## Introduction

The project involves importing libraries, reading datasets, generating profiles using pandas profiling, visualizing the dataset, validating missing values, selecting models, evaluating model performance, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Regression_Project.ipynb`) in a Jupyter Notebook environment, such as Visual Studio Code with the Jupyter extension installed.
3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and analyze the dataset.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook (`RealEstate.ipynb`) serves as the main entry point for the project. It contains code for data analysis, model selection, evaluation, and prediction.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `ydata_profiling`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
